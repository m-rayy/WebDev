//Solve these problems:

//Create a one line function that adds two parameters
const addTwoParam = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(addTwoParam(2, 2));

//Closure: What does the last line return?
const addTo = x => y => x + y
var addToTen = addTo(10)
addToTen(3)
// 10 + 3 = 13


//Currying: What does the last line return?
const sum = (a, b) => a + b
const curriedSum = (a) => (b) => a + b
curriedSum(30)(1)
// 30 + 1 = 31


//Currying: What does the last line return?
const sum2 = (a, b) => a + b
const curriedSum2 = (a) => (b) => a + b
const add5 = curriedSum2(5)
add5(12)
// 5 + 12 = 17


//Composing: What does the last line return?
const compose = (f, g) => (a) => f(g(a));
const addOne = (num) => num + 1;
const addFive = (num) => num + 5;
compose(addOne, addFive)(10)
// (10 + 5) + 1 = 16


//What are the two elements of a pure function?
// 1. Deterministic: always produces the same results given the same inputs
// 2. No Side Effects:  It does not depend on any state, or data, change during a programâ€™s execution. It must only depend on its input elements.
