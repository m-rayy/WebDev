Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter. 


.class
#id
*
element
element.class                   # select class of element
element1, element2
element1 element2               # element2 inside of element1
element1 > element2             # element1 is immediate parent of element2
element1 + element2             # element2 is exactly after element1
element1 ~ element2             # all (multiple) element2 that follows element1
:hover                          # for when mouse hovers over element
:first-child                    # first element that is inside of another element
:only-child                     # only element that is inside of another element  
:last-child                     # last element that is inside of another element
:nth-child(N)                   # nth element (N) that is inside of another element
:nth-last-child                 # nth element (N) in reverse order that is inside of another element
:first-of-type                  # first element of that type within another element
:nth-of-type(N)                 # specific element based on its type and order (N, even, odd) in another element
:nth-of-type(Nn+Start)           # selects every nth (N) element, starting the count at a specific instance (Start) of that element

!important (not recommended)    # overwrites cascading styles


What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity
-Importance
-Source Orderplate
